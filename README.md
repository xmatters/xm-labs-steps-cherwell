## xMatters Setup
1. Download the [CherwellSteps.zip](./CherwellSteps.zip) file onto your local computer
2. Navigate to the Developer tab of your xMatters instance
3. Click **Import Plan**, and select the zip file you just downloaded


## Usage
Note: To use the Cherwell actions, you must have a Cherwell server with an exposed endpoint, or with the xMatters agent installed. For instructions on installing the xMatters agent, [see here](https://help.xmatters.com/ondemand/xmodwelcome/xmattersagent/xmatters-agent-topic.htm)

### Create Incident Step
Note: It may be in your interest to create a Constant for the Customer ID in the Integration Builder so you can drag in the Customer ID from the constants rather than pasting the value each time you want to use the step.
1. To use the Create Incident Step, click and drag it into the flow, then double click the step to edit it
2. In the **Setup** tab, fill out or drag in the required inputs - `Short Description`, `Description`, `Owned By Team`, `Priority`, and `Customer ID`
3. In the **Run Location** tab, leave it on `Cloud` if you have an exposed endpoint, or change it to `xMatters agent` if you installed the agent, then select the Cherwell server
4. In the **Endpoint** tab, click `Create Endpoint`, and fill it out with the following values

### Annotate Object Step
1. To use the Annotate Object Step, click and drag it into the flow, then double click the step to edit it
2. In the **Setup** tab, fill out or drag in the required inputs - `Parent Rec ID`, `Parent Type Name`, and `Details`
3. In the **Run Location** tab, leave it on `Cloud` if you have an exposed endpoint, or change it to `xMatters agent` if you installed the agent, then select the Cherwell server
4. In the **Endpoint** tab, click `Create Endpoint`, and fill it out with the following values

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Cherwell |
| Base URL | `Cherwell Base URL` |
| Authentication Type | OAuth2 |
| Grant Type | Password |
| Access Token URL | `Cherwell Base URL`/CherwellApi/token |
| Username | `Cherwell Username` |
| Password | `Cherwell Password` |
| Client ID | `Cherwell Client ID` |
* `Cherwell Base URL` will be http://localhost if you have installed the xMatters agent, or whatever exposed URL you have if not
* `Cherwell Username` and `Cherwell Password` are your username and password
* `Cherwell Client ID` is the client id you created in [Cherwell Setup](#cherwell-setup)
